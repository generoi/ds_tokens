Display Suite Tokens
====================

Provide additional tokens integration for Display Suite

Currently this module provide tokens replacement for the layout attributes
field so that layouts for example could set a data attribute to a field value.

Eg. `data-image="[node:field_image:file:url]" data-title="[node:title]"`
